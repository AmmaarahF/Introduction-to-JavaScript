# Introduction-to-JavaScript

What is JavaScript ? 
-------------------------
JavaScript is a high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers.

What is it used for ?
-------------------------
It's commonly used for adding functionality to web pages, building web applications, developing server-side applications.

JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types:- 
> Numbers - 123, 120.50, etc
> String - "text"
> Boolean - true or false

- JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, <b>null</b> and <b>undefined</b>
- JavaScript supports a composite data type known as an <b>object</b>.
- JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values.
- JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard.


 JavaScript Variables
 -------------------------
 - Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it.
 - Variables are declared with the <b>var</b> keyword , eg. var money; 
 - You can also declare multiple variables with the same var keyword, eg. var money, name;
 - Storing a value in a variable is called variable <b>initialization</b>.
 - You can assign a value at the time of initialization. Eg, var money; and then 'money = 200.50;' below that
